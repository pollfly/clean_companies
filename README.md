# clean_companies

Clean Companies is a website to find whether companies are environmentally friendly and following human rights laws. 

All necessary code is in the company_app folder. The information was gathered using a parser, used in a function in the database_web_crawl.py file. 
The parser function doesn't have to be used, all the information is also available in company.db database, in the clean_companies files.
